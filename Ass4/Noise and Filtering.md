# 🧪 Lab 4 — Noise and Filtering

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this lab is to model common image noise types and compare different filtering methods for noise reduction.  
We also measure image quality using Mean Square Error (MSE).

## 1️⃣ Adding Different Noise Types

**Explanation:**  
- The original image (`peppers.png`) was converted to grayscale.  
- Gaussian noise (σ² = 0.01) and Salt & Pepper noise (density = 0.05) were added.  
- Gaussian noise appears as smooth grain, while salt & pepper shows sharp white and black pixels.

## 2️⃣ Computing Simple Quality Metrics
**Explanation:**  
- Mean Square Error (MSE) was calculated between the original and noisy images.  
- Expected output (example):  

- Salt & Pepper noise produces higher MSE, meaning stronger degradation.

## 3️⃣ Linear Filtering (Mean & Gaussian Filters)
![linear_filters](results/L4_2.png)  
**Explanation:**  
- Applied a 3×3 average filter and a 3×3 Gaussian filter (σ = 0.7).  
- Both reduce noise, but linear filters blur edges slightly.  
- Gaussian filtering maintains smoother transitions than the mean filter.

## 4️⃣ Non-linear Filtering (Median Filter)
**Explanation:**  
- Median filtering was applied to both Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noisy images.  
- The median filter effectively removed salt & pepper noise without blurring edges.  
- For Gaussian noise, the improvement was moderate compared to linear filters.
